# Hotel-manegement-network
This project simulates a Smart Hotel Management Network using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on secure, scalable, and efficient network design for a multi-floor hotel environment. The network is divided into multiple functional segments to support hotel operations, guest connectivity, and IoT-based automation.

The system includes separate logical networks for Reception, Housekeeping, Guest Wi-Fi, Server Room, and IoT devices, ensuring traffic isolation and improved security. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to automatically assign IP addresses to all devices, simplifying network management. A centralized server hosts a web-based hotel booking portal, while a dedicated IoT server manages smart devices such as lights, smoke detectors, and appliances.

Wireless connectivity is provided through multiple Access Points deployed across floors, enabling seamless guest Wi-Fi access and IoT communication. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are implemented to restrict guest access to internal networks while allowing essential services such as DHCP and Internet access. The project demonstrates real-world enterprise networking concepts including VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN communication, centralized services, wireless networking, and IoT integration.

This simulation reflects how modern hotels can leverage networking and IoT technologies to enhance operational efficiency, security, and guest experience.
